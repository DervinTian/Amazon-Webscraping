# Amazon-Webscraping

## Introduction to Web Scraping

Web scraping is the process of automatically extracting data from websites. Itâ€™s commonly used to gather large amounts of information from the web without having to manually copy and paste content. Web scraping can be done using various tools and libraries, with Python being one of the most popular languages for this task. Scraping works by navigating through the website's HTML structure searching through specific tags in order to find and extract specific data.

## About our Project

The goal of our project was to help users like you make smarter purchasing choices. Our program will prompt you, the user, for a specific search query. It will then go to the corresponding Amazon page where it will begin to scrape the webpage extracting the product's price and rating. To help you visualize which products are the most valuable, our program outputs the mean price of the product, the standard deviation of price, as well as a price-to-rating graph.

## How to Use our Project

Our project is very simple to use. The program will prompt you for a product. It will then redirect you to the product's page on Amazon on a separate tab. The program will also display the mean price, standard deviation as well as the price-to-rating graph. By looking at the graph, you will be able to see how far each individual product deviates away from the mean to help  you make better informed purchasing decisions. 

**NOTE THIS PROGRAM IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH CURRENT VERSIONS OF AMAZON AS OF 9/7/2024.
